## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore network data using the R programming language
- Utilize contemporary network R libraries including *statnet* and *igraph*
- Visualize network data
- Partition networks using contemporary community detection methods
- Formulate data-driven hypotheses about relational systems using network analysis tools

## Course Overview


The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions with network data structures using the R programming language. In particular, we will discuss the following topics

- History of Networks
- Network Applications
- Types of Network data: static, temporal, multilayer, directed, undirected, bipartite
- Structural Importance and Centrality
- Topological Summaries of Networks
- Shortest Paths
- Automatic Feature Learning of Graphs
- Mesoscopic Properties of Graphs
- Community Detection
- Epidemics on Networks
- Intro to Statistical Network Modeling
